### üìö Tutorial

For solution videos open a Leetcode problem's
[solutions tab](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/solutions)

 If you pin the extension in the toolbar & login into ChatGPT in your browser, you can use the following 2 GPT buttons:

- Get your code complexity using ChatGPT
- Fix bugs in your code and return the optimal solution

Please ensure your Leetcode solution is open so the extension can read your code from the page.
